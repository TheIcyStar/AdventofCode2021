# Icy's AdventofCode2021 repo
Advent of code participation! https://adventofcode.com/2021

Trying some stuff out, feel free to poke around.
Contains spoilers! Try out the coding problems yourself before checking out what I wrote

The project is split up into modules. The modules are in *src/days*, and their names start with the day number.
Any input data for each module is a text file in the *input* folder

# How to Set Up and Run:
0) Install NodeJS
1) Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies
2) Run `tsc` to build the project
3) Run `npm run start <DAY NUMBER>` to run a day's module
